## Content
This is a static HTML site with the shortcuts to the particular services
at our radio Station ED1R.

This site is hosted within the internal network and requires therefore no
access control. All files (including external dependencies) are included
in this repository. This allows to properly serve the site, even when the
internet connection is down.

There is also [another version of this dashboard](https://github.com/dh1tw/ed1r-operational-services) which we use for remote control
of the station.
